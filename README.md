# Microsoft Power BI Accessibility Checker
This repository is for a capstone project at the University of Washington in partnership with Microsoft to make Power BI reports more accessible for people with disabilities.

The end result will be an accessibility checker that Power BI report creators can run to find issues in their report. Eventually, we hope that some of this will be integrated into the report creation process to make accessibility additions seamless and less of an afterthought

## What it will include:
* code to integrate Microsoft's [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://github.com/microsoft/accessibility-insights-web) open source checker
* a user interface that allows you to run the checker and recieve a report
* documentation

## What it may include:
* an outline for a feedback form report viewers can use to give suggestions to report creators for making their report more accessible
* additional tests not included in Microsoft's [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://github.com/microsoft/accessibility-insights-web) application
* suggestions generated for the report creator by the checker
* a report for Microsoft on how the checker can be integrated into the report creation process
* a report for Microsoft on changes they can make to default settings to make all reports more accessible and make the accessibility features more apparent to report creators
